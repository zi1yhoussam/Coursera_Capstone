    "# 1. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly define a problem and the audience who would be interested in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Scenario and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more and more international students choose to study aboard these days. More than 100,000 students from around the world came to study in New York in 2017, which is 11% of all international students coming to the United States. New York is undoubtedly one of the most student-preferred cities in the country, and for good reason. However, when those students first come to New York, find a good neighborhood to live sometimes can be stressful. It also takes a lot of time for international students to search unstructured information from multiple sources such as internet, newsletter, google etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findinng a good neighborhood to live is easy. There are so many factors need to be taken into consideration:\n",
    "* Transportation - students would more prefere to choose place with comvenient transportation.\n",
    "* Ammenities in the neighborhood - such as international cousine restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this final project, I would like to apply the data science skills I learned from the Coursera course to give those international students more insights and information when choosing neighborhood in Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem I'm trying to resolve is tp help Lam - an internationl student to find a rental apartment unit in Manhattan, New York to meet his requirement best based on their preference. For this case, Lam wants his new rental unit meet the following conditions:\n",
    "* The rental unit located in Manhattan, New York\n",
    "* The rental unit has at least 2 bedrooms\n",
    "* The monthly rental not to exceed US$7500/month\n",
    "* The rental unit located in a radius of 1 mile of a subway station\n",
    "* The rental unit located in the neighborhood with ammenities and venues similar to Lam's home in Hongkong. ( Lam currently resides in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui East in Honkong. Based on venues around the area of residence data provided by FourSquare - which are shown in the Hongkong map shown in methodology and execution in section 3.0. It serves as a reference for comparison with the desired future location in Manhattan, New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Potential Audience \n",
    "\n",
    "The data science methodology I implement in this case will be beneficial to anyone who want to find a ideal neighborhood/house/apartment in foreign country. You may just recieved a job offer from your dream company in another city/country you are not familiar with but you need to relocate immediately; You may just recieved the offer from your dream college and need to find a good neighborhood to live... My approach and meghodologies will help you to solve this kind of problems."
